# HealthBuddy Chatbot: Project Summary

## Business Goal
HealthBuddy aims to improve medication adherence and health monitoring for individuals with chronic conditions by providing an accessible, conversational interface through WhatsApp. The chatbot will help users track health metrics, remind them of medications, and provide personalized wellness tips.

## Target Audience
- **Primary:** Individuals managing chronic health conditions (diabetes, hypertension, etc.)
- **Secondary:** Elderly individuals who need medication reminders
- **Tertiary:** Health-conscious individuals tracking wellness metrics

## Key Features and Capabilities

### 1. Health Tracking
- Daily logging of vital metrics (blood pressure, glucose levels, weight, etc.)
- Trend visualization and anomaly detection
- Monthly health reports

### 2. Medication Management
- Medication reminders with confirmation
- Medication inventory tracking
- Refill notifications

### 3. Appointment Scheduling
- Doctor appointment reminders
- Quick scheduling of new appointments
- Follow-up prompts after appointments

### 4. Personalized Wellness Tips
- Condition-specific health advice
- Dietary recommendations based on tracked metrics
- Exercise suggestions appropriate to user's condition

### 5. Emergency Support
- Quick access to emergency contacts
- Abnormal reading alerts
- SOS message capability

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Daily Health Tracking
1. User receives morning prompt: "Good morning! Time to check your blood pressure."
2. User responds with reading: "120/80"
3. Chatbot logs data, provides feedback: "Great! Your blood pressure is within normal range."
4. Chatbot asks about other metrics or symptoms as needed

### Scenario 2: Medication Reminder
1. Chatbot sends reminder: "It's time to take your Metformin (500mg)."
2. User confirms: "Taken"
3. Chatbot updates records and responds: "Great! Your next medication (Lisinopril) is due at 8:00 PM."

### Scenario 3: Health Anomaly
1. User reports unusual reading: "My glucose is 240 today"
2. Chatbot identifies abnormal reading and responds with appropriate guidance: "This reading is higher than your normal range. Have you eaten in the last 2 hours? Consider checking again in 30 minutes. If it remains above 200, please contact your healthcare provider."
